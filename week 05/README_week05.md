# Heart Diseases Cleaned Dataset

Data analytics project for cleaning and analyzing heart disease data to identify risk factors and patterns for cardiovascular health assessment.

## Overview

This project involves comprehensive cleaning and analysis of heart disease patient data to uncover insights about risk factors, correlations, and patient demographics.

## Dataset Features

Patient health metrics including:
- Age and gender
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Heart rate
- ECG results
- Exercise data
- Diagnosis outcomes

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Components

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Missing value imputation
   - Outlier detection and handling
   - Data type standardization
   - Quality validation

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Demographic analysis
   - Risk factor identification
   - Correlation analysis
   - Distribution studies

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Feature correlations
   - Group comparisons
   - Hypothesis testing
   - Pattern recognition

4. **Visualization**
   - Health metric distributions
   - Risk factor heatmaps
   - Demographic breakdowns
   - Correlation matrices

## Key Findings

- Major risk factors for heart disease
- Age and gender-based patterns
- Correlation between lifestyle and health metrics
- High-risk patient profiles

## Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
